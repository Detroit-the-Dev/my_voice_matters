My Voice Matters

My Voice Matters is a web-based simple-by-design communication board. (No login required.) It will be used by someone with a speech or language impairment to communicate. When buttons with customized symbols are clicked it will "speak" the selected word. The app will enable carers or users of AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) the ability to create personalized speech generation for their loved one or themselves.
